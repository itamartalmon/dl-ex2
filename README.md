# dl-ex2

Ex2 of deep learning course in TAU

EX2.py is the main file:

Q1 is done except of producing the plot
Q2 has the detector implemented to output the elliptic bounds, still needs to un it on FDDB
I also added the trained CNNs models

I this you can start Q3 (at least the 24NET implementation)
