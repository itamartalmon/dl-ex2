Ex2 of deep learning course in TAU

EX2.py is the main file:

Q1 is done except of producing the plot
Q2 is half way done, the FCN is implemented but I still need to output the bounding boxes in the correct format
I also added the trained CNNs models

I this you can start Q3 (at least the 24NET implementation)
