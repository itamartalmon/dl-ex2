# dl-ex2

Ex2 of deep learning course in TAU

EX2.py is the main file:

Q1  coding is done (we could retrain with more epochs since it keeps getting better)
Q2 coding is done (can't run the checks on my windows laptop and Nova fails for openCV issue)
Q3 coding is done (we should retrain with more epochs)
Q4 - Implemented Detector (without testing it). Still needs to implement the main function (read, detect and output). Should be almost copy-paste from Q2.
